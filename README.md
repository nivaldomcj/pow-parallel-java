# Proof of Work

This project is a simple proof of work implementation for academic purposes. All the credits goes to <a href="https://github.com/marcelohweb/">@marcelohweb</a>.

My only modification was just creating a new file (ProofOfWorkParallel.java) based on the sources on an attempt to create a "parallel" version using threads, for academic / explanation purposes.
